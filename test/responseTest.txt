Brakes were added to cars for one primary reason: to slow down and stop vehicles. Here's a more detailed explanation: 

* **Safety:**  The most significant reason for the introduction of brakes in cars is to improve safety. Cars are designed to travel at high speeds in various situations, and without brakes, a vehicle would pose a significant danger to both the driver and the occupants, as well as pedestrians. Brakes allow drivers to safely slow down or stop on demand, thereby preventing accidents. 

* **Controllability:** Brakes also contribute to the overall controllability of a vehicle, enabling drivers to execute precise maneuvers and maintain stable control. This is crucial for avoiding obstacles, making sharp turns, and slowing down smoothly in traffic. 

* **Particle Theory with Heat.** Modern braking systems utilize friction. When brakes are applied, the friction slows the car down. Heat is an energy transformation that occurs as a result of friction. Friction converts kinetic energy into heat energy. Therefore, the friction of the brake pad with the wheel generates enough heat to increase the rate of dissipation of energy from the system.


* **Preventing Collisions and Explosions:** Brakes, particularly in electric vehicles, can significantly reduce the energy generated by braking. This energy can be transformed into electrical energy. This can impact several safety aspects:  
   * Fires: In older cars, the friction generated by the brakes can generate excessive heat, leading to brake pad overheating and fire hazards. Modern braking systems are less prone to this problem. 
   * Environmental Impacts: By reducing emissions, brakes can help promote environmental sustainability.

In essence, brakes act as a pivotal safety feature, enhancing vehicle control and mitigating collisions. Prior to their development, traveling by car was significantly riskier.
